# Algorithm-Visualization
I implemented a fun small idea of visualizing different Sort and Search algorithms in JavaScript using p5.js:)

The Project consists of a GUI which handles the visualization, aswell as the two files containing the algorithms and the html and css files configuring the web-end parts
